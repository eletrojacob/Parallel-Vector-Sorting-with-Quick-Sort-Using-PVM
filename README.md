# Parallel Vector Sorting with Quick Sort Using PVM

This repository demonstrates the use of **PVM (Parallel Virtual Machine)** to implement parallel sorting of an integer vector using the **Quick Sort** algorithm. The project is divided into a **master** process and multiple **slave** processes. The master coordinates the workload distribution, while the slaves independently sort portions of the vector in parallel.

## üí° Motivation

Sorting large datasets can be computationally expensive. By leveraging PVM, this project distributes the sorting workload across multiple processes (potentially on different hosts), enabling efficient parallel processing. It showcases the practical use of PVM for task coordination and message passing in a distributed system.

## üöÄ Project Structure

The repository contains the following key files:

- **`sort.c`**: The master program that divides the vector, spawns parallel tasks, and merges the sorted sub-vectors.
- **`quick.c`**: The slave program that performs the Quick Sort on its assigned portion of the vector.
- **`Makefile`**: A build script for compiling the programs.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

1. **Data Division**:
   - The master program divides the main vector into equal-sized sub-vectors.
   - Each sub-vector is sent to a slave process for sorting.

2. **Parallel Quick Sort**:
   - The slave program receives a sub-vector and applies the Quick Sort algorithm.
   - The sorted sub-vector is sent back to the master.

3. **Merging**:
   - The master program collects the sorted sub-vectors from all slaves and merges them into a fully sorted vector.

## üìÇ Repository Contents

- **`sort.c`**:
  - Manages the vector division, task spawning, message passing, and merging.
  - Uses the PVM library to communicate with slave processes.

- **`quick.c`**:
  - Implements the Quick Sort algorithm on a portion of the vector received from the master.
  - Sends the sorted results back to the master.

- **`Makefile`**:
  - Facilitates easy compilation of the source files.
